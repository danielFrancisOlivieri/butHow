                    The Google logo likes to play dress-up. On one day the letters are made out of portholes to celebrate Jules Verne, on another they’re forming the walls of a PAC-MAN game that you can actually play. Whatever the Google logo happens to be wearing, you can look under it to see the search bar. This search bar is one of the most powerful rectangles humanity has ever invented, along with credit cards and hundred dollar bills. Through this little slat of an input bar you can venture out to explore any province of the internet. Underneath this rectangle are two stouter rectangles labelled “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky.” Outside of the logo and these three rectangles, the page is white. Just plain white. There is a slice of grey at the bottom of the page, but that’s it. Google’s empire all began with its ability to make the internet simple and it has stuck to its guns.
</p>
<p>
                      This simplicity requires vast complexity. You can pull back the curtain and see it for yourself. If you right click on Google’s homepage and select “View Page Source” a new tab will spring open. Backstage you’ll see that the simple Google homepage is held in place by an entire novella of code (42,707 words to be exact). There are brackets, hashtag signs and strands of letters that don’t even merit an attempt at pronunciation. It looks to be somewhere between gibberish and gobbledygook. Paradoxically, it’s this stuff that seems like nonsense that functions with the utmost order and precision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google’s homepage, like most computer programs, has been designed so that we do not notice the absurdly complex mechanisms that make them possible. This is because computers are designed to be used, not to be marvelled at. Just as the engine of a car is hidden underneath a hood, the thousands of lines of code are hidden behind the buttons we click and the graphics we stare at. The thing about a plane’s turbines is that you can see them. You may not understand the mechanics of an internal combustion engine, but you’ve still have a general idea of what’s going on. There is a sense of cause and effect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There may be a hood over it, but you can imagine your way under the hood. If you are the one paying for gas, you are likely painfully aware that certain things are required for your car to move. You have some sense of cause and effect.
</p>
<p>
                    Cause: the engine burns the oil and the axles to turn
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Effect: the car moves forward and gets you to Barnes & Nobles before they close.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This works with many mechanical devices. The specifics may elude you, but the general concepts make sense. If asked, you could explain it to a five year-old without having to make too much up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Computer programs are a bit different. Unlike other technologies, code appears to be all effect and no cause. This, I propose, is why computer programs seem like magic. Everything seems like magic until it’s explained. Joseph Campbell explained that computers are like Old Testament God, lots of rules and no mercy. The comparison to God is especially interesting because it brings us back to cause and effect. God is sometimes referred to as the General Cause. God seems to be all effects and no cause. A magician's trick seems like magic (if it’s done well anyway) in the moment. What makes a trick a trick is that the magician does something while hiding how she does it. Everyday when you open up microsoft word or play frogger, the computer once again pulls the rabbit out of the hat. The point of this essay is to show you that the rabbit was in the hat all along, to show you that your uncle didn’t actually find the dime behind your ear, to take off the computer’s sleeves and show you the tricks hidden there. Three thousand words cannot hope to teach you these tricks, but it will hopefully be enough to show you that they are just tricks.

                    In 1833, you could go to a dinner party in London and hear the sound of computation. It would be a click-click-clicking sound. Number discs would spin in place, gears would churn against each other, and all of it powered by a hand crank. The device was about two feet high. It would be doing two things: adding and subtracting. It was the first mechanical calculator.
      	This machine, called the Difference Engine, was devised in 1843 by British mathematician Charles Babbage. While Babbage never managed to produce a full version (the government cut his funding) but he did manage to produce a partial one. Over a decade before Lincoln came to office, Babbage was beginning to tackle the problem that would lead to the computer you have in front of you right now. What this problem was the mechanization of thought. For millions of years, humanity had risen above the animals by outsourcing functions of its body to tools. Legs became improved by the wheel, endurance hunting became improved by the bow and arrow. But now, Babbage was creating a machine that could take over humanity’s power to think. This machine does with gears and cranks what humans do with neural synapses.
      </p>
      <p>
      With all of its complexity and shrewd design, Babbage could teach a machine to do something a seven year-old can do. The advantage that this machine has over your average first grader is speed. It would require several school districts worth of children to match this machine’s speed at addition and subtraction. By adding and subtracting again and again this machine could find the value of polynomial functions.
      	But while this Difference Machine can compute things, it is not a computer in the modern sense. It is not a computer because it does not take directions. It is build for just the one purpose. The only way to reprogram it would be to take it apart and build it all over again.
      </p>
      <p>
      	The intellectual jump required to imagine programming hinged on a party. It was a garden party where Charles Babbage met a seventeen year old mathematician named Ada Lovelace. The daughter of Lord Byron (yes, that lord Byron), Ada Lovelace was fantastically educated. She was fascinated with Babbage’s Difference Engine and became close colleague with Charles Babbage.
      Together, they translated a paper on computing into English from Italian. But in addition to just translating it, they also added notes. In these notes lies the DNA of coding languages such as JavaScript and C++. What Ada Lovelace did was write out a list of instructions. If followed, these instructions could lead a machine to hypothetically calculate Bernoulli numbers. What was revolutionary about this was the idea of communicating with a machine. You could tell one machine to do many different tasks for you if only you taught it how to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      	That list of instructions was the first computer program. Unfortunately, Ada Lovelace wrote it a century before the first computer. But not only did Ada Lovelace invent the beginnings of programming, she also had the vision to see where it might go. Ada Lovelace considered the possibility that computers could one day produce graphics or music. That’s right. Back in the mid 1800s Ada Lovelace was already envisioning techno.
      About this theoretical device known as the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, “...there is no finite line of demarcation which limits the powers of the Analytical Engine.” Now, over a century and a half later, 18 million programmers wake up every weekday and prove Ada’s statement correct. Things are different now. Duties once assigned to metal discs are now given to electrons. The essential idea is the same though: teach machines. By writing new code, they keep pushing that line further and showing that there is yet more that machines can be taught to do. And now you are going to join them in that.

                The fun of coding is that you get to invent the shit out of things with your keyboard. You can wizard things into existance with just your time and your intelligence. There is wittiness in coding. You can do things faster if you're smarter. No matter how good and fast a computer is, it's the genius of the algorithms in it that determines how quick it'll run.
                     There is the potential for turning your language not just into words but into actual seeable things. You words are spells, they turn gears and crank cranks. There is a strength to it, a huge amount of respect.
              </p>
              <p>   It's also aesthetically beautiful, I think. </p>
                  <p>
                     There is a thrill to seeing the underside of anything. You need to familiarize yourself with it. You need to get comfortable with the grossness of it, comfortable with the terror. This is the power of code. It's the power to split open the mind and let it actually wrap around the computer and control it.
                      There is a lot of frustration. There will be a million nights of thinking. If only I saw that one parenthesis! There's a lot of testing. It is a meticulous process if done correctly. There are so many different mistakes to be made.
