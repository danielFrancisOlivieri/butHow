                    The Google logo likes to play dress-up. On one day the letters are made out of portholes to celebrate Jules Verne, on another they’re forming the walls of a PAC-MAN game that you can actually play. Whatever the Google logo happens to be wearing, you can look under it to see the search bar. This search bar is one of the most powerful rectangles humanity has ever invented, along with credit cards and hundred dollar bills. Through this little slat of an input bar you can venture out to explore any province of the internet. Underneath this rectangle are two stouter rectangles labelled “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky.” Outside of the logo and these three rectangles, the page is white. Just plain white. There is a slice of grey at the bottom of the page, but that’s it. Google’s empire all began with its ability to make the internet simple and it has stuck to its guns.
</p>
<p>
                      This simplicity requires vast complexity. You can pull back the curtain and see it for yourself. If you right click on Google’s homepage and select “View Page Source” a new tab will spring open. Backstage you’ll see that the simple Google homepage is held in place by an entire <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "42,707 words to be exact"  style="display:inline;" > novella of code </span>. There are brackets, hashtag signs and strands of letters that don’t even merit an attempt at pronunciation. It looks to be somewhere between gibberish and gobbledygook. Paradoxically, it’s this stuff that seems like nonsense that functions with the utmost order and precision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google’s homepage, like most computer programs, has been designed so that we do not notice the absurdly complex mechanisms that make them possible. This is because computers are designed to be used, not to be marvelled at. Just as the engine of a car is hidden underneath a hood, the thousands of lines of code are hidden behind the buttons we click and the graphics we stare at. The thing about a plane’s turbines is that you can see them. You may not understand the mechanics of an internal combustion engine, but you’ve still have a general idea of what’s going on. There is a sense of cause and effect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There may be a hood over it, but you can imagine your way under the hood. If you are the one paying for gas, you are likely painfully aware that certain things are required for your car to move. You have some sense of cause and effect.
</p>
<p>
                    Cause: the engine burns the oil and the axles to turn
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Effect: the car moves forward and gets you to Barnes & Nobles before they close.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This works with many mechanical devices. The specifics may elude you, but the general concepts make sense. If asked, you could explain it to a five year-old without having to make too much up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Computer programs are a bit different. Unlike other technologies, code appears to be all effect and no cause. This, I propose, is why computer programs seem like magic. Everything seems like magic until it’s explained. Joseph Campbell explained that computers are like Old Testament God, lots of rules and no mercy. The comparison to God is especially interesting because it brings us back to cause and effect. God is sometimes referred to as the General Cause. God seems to be all effects and no cause. A magician's trick seems like magic (if it’s done well anyway) in the moment. What makes a trick a trick is that the magician does something while hiding how she does it. Everyday when you open up microsoft word or play frogger, the computer once again pulls the rabbit out of the hat. The point of this essay is to show you that the rabbit was in the hat all along, to show you that your uncle didn’t actually find the dime behind your ear, to take off the computer’s sleeves and show you the tricks hidden there. Three thousand words cannot hope to teach you these tricks, but it will hopefully be enough to show you that they are just tricks.

                    In 1833, you could go to a dinner party in London and hear the sound of computation. It would be a click-click-clicking sound. Number discs would spin in place, gears would churn against each other, and all of it powered by a hand crank. The device was about two feet high. It would be doing two things: adding and subtracting. It was the first mechanical calculator.
      	This machine, called the Difference Engine, was devised in 1843 by British mathematician Charles Babbage. While Babbage <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "The British government cut his funding when the project was half done and ten times over budget"  style="display:inline;" > never managed to produce a full version </span> but he did manage to produce a partial one. Over a decade before Lincoln came to office, Babbage was beginning to tackle the problem that would lead to the computer you have in front of you right now. What this problem was the mechanization of thought. For millions of years, humanity had risen above the animals by outsourcing functions of its body to tools. Legs became improved by the wheel, endurance hunting became improved by the bow and arrow. But now, Babbage was creating a machine that could take over humanity’s power to think. This machine does with gears and cranks what humans do with neural synapses.
      </p>
      <p>
      With all of its complexity and shrewd design, Babbage could teach a machine to do something a seven year-old can do. The advantage that this machine has over your average first grader is speed. It would require several school districts worth of children to match this machine’s speed at addition and subtraction. By adding and subtracting again and again this machine could find the value of polynomial functions.
      	But while this Difference Engine can compute things, it is not a computer in the modern sense. It is not a computer because it does not take directions. It is build for just the one purpose. The only way to reprogram it would be to take it apart and build it all over again.
      </p>
      <p>
      	The intellectual jump required to imagine programming hinged on a party. It was a garden party where Charles Babbage met a seventeen year old mathematician named Ada Lovelace . The daughter of <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "Yes, that lord Byron"  style="display:inline;" > Lord Byron, </span> Ada Lovelace was fantastically educated. She was fascinated with Babbage’s Difference Engine and became close colleague with Charles Babbage.
      Together, they translated a paper on computing into English from Italian. But in addition to just translating it, they also added notes. In these notes lies the DNA of coding languages such as JavaScript and C++. What Ada Lovelace did was write out a list of instructions. If followed, these instructions could lead a machine to hypothetically calculate Bernoulli numbers. What was revolutionary about this was the idea of communicating with a machine. You could tell one machine to do many different tasks for you if only you taught it how to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      	That list of instructions was the first computer program. Unfortunately, Ada Lovelace wrote it a century before the first computer. But not only did Ada Lovelace invent the beginnings of programming, she also had the vision to see where it might go. Ada Lovelace considered the possibility that computers could one day produce graphics or music. That’s right. Back in the mid 1800s Ada Lovelace was already envisioning techno.
      About this theoretical device known as the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, “...there is no finite line of demarcation which limits the powers of the Analytical Engine.” Now, over a century and a half later, 18 million programmers wake up every weekday and prove Ada’s statement correct. Things are different now. Duties once assigned to metal discs are now given to electrons. The essential idea is the same though: teach machines. By writing new code, they keep pushing that line further and showing that there is yet more that machines can be taught to do. And now you are going to join them in that.

              Man’s first best friend is praised for its extreme loyalty. Man’s new best friend, computers, is hated for it’s extreme loyalty. What makes computer programming frustrating is that computers are loyal to what you said, not what you meant to say. For example, a few sentences back I wrote, “it’s” where I should have written “its.” Perhaps you noticed this and perhaps you didn’t. Either way, you certainly understood what I was trying to say. Computers do not work that way. If you make a <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "this is called a syntax error"  style="display:inline;" > simple grammatical mistake in a line of code </span>, the computer will not be able to read that line. It will pout and give you error messages until you find the error. Sometimes it can take vast amounts of time to find said error.
            </p>
            <p>
             	But those are often the better mistakes to have. Those ones the computer will point out for you. The other kind of error is what I think of as the Calvin error.

              <p>
                A computer program is like Calvin. You might think, "I know what I mean! It's obvious what I really meant." Computers do not follow what you meant to say. they follow what you said. And they will follow what you said no matter how disastrous the consequences (this kind of mistake is known as a logic error). This means that if you tell a computer program to run forever, it will do its best to run forever. If you <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "this is pretty common"  style="display:inline;" > accidentally tell your computer to delete your memory </span> then it will do just that.

              </p>

              <p>
                Computer programming is essentially translation. It starts with an idea in your head and ends with the idea sitting in the computer’s processor as binary code. Now, binary doesn’t exactly <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "Here’s Hamlet’s most famous line written in Binary: 01110100 01101111 00100000 01100010 01100101 00100000 01101111 01110010 00100000 01101110 01101111 01110100 00100000 01110100 01101111 00100000 01100010 01100101"  style="display:inline;" > flow off the tongue </span>. This is where programming languages come in. You translate your idea into code and run the program. Then the computer starts a game of very precise whisper down the lane. It translates the JavaScript into another language. Then it translates that into yet another language. With each level it gets more and more complex, further from <span class = "hint--top hint--rounded"  aria-label = "Just about every popular programming langauge is written in English"  style="display:inline;" > English </span> and closer to Binary. In some programming languages this happens all at once before the program runs. In others, this happens as the program runs. JavaScript, the language we're going to use, goes line by line.

The sentence, “There is a person called Ada” can be translated into this Javascript:
              </p>
<pre>
var aPerson = “Ada”;
</pre>
            <p>  The first word, <code>var</code>  just tells the computer that you want it to make a brand-new variable. The word, <code>aPerson</code> is the variable where the name will be stored. This variable can be any collection of letters. You could name a variable splurbek or nudfasdaesd or even sens. I don’t recommend you do, though, because none of those variable names quite make sense. The equals sign says, “Make the variable on the left equal whatever is on the right.” We all know that <code>“Ada”</code> is the name of the first programmer. The semicolon at the end is just like a period. It lets the program know that the sentence is over.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many different types of variables. Variables can be filled with numbers too. You can do arithmetic with them.

          <pre>
            var six = 6;
var two = 2;
var eight = six + two; // addition
var four = six -  two; // subtraction
var twelve = six * two; // multiplication
var three = six / two; // division

                Code is hard to understand, no matter who you are. And so we want to explain it. That's where comments come in. Comments are parts of the code that the computer will ignore. They are there to allow coders to explain what is going on in their code.
                    You can write anything you want in there from your opinions on street magicians to a screed against your ex-boyfriend. There's a lot to do. Most employers won’t appreciate if you do that though. Especially if your employer is a part-time street magician. Or if your employer is your ex-boyfriend. Or both.

              </p>
<pre>
// Clyde! The only thing you could ever really make disappear was my feelings for you!
</pre>
      <p>
It can be tiresome, writing // at the beginning of every line. Because of that, there’s another option for making comments. You can also do this:
</p>

<pre>
  /*
      Clyde, you are terrible at talking to crowds, that's why you can't get any real magician gigs.
      Oh, and performing tricks at your nephew Jeremy's birthday party doesn't count as a gig!
      And PS, Jeremy told me later that he knew all along that you had the dime in your hand. He just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
  */
</pre>

<p>
Everything in between the /* and the */ is a comment. This means it will be ignored by the computer. It will likely not be ignored by your boss/ex.

              <p>
                One of the most important things about programming is a Henry David Thoreau quote, “Simplify, simplify.” Functions allow you to simplify code by separating the cause from the effect. Here is the code for the function append.
              </p>
<pre>
  append: function() {
  		return domManip( this, arguments, function( elem ) {
  			if ( this.nodeType === 1 || this.nodeType === 11 || this.nodeType === 9 ) {
  				var target = manipulationTarget( this, elem );
  				target.appendChild( elem );
  			}
  		} );
  	}
</pre>
      <p>Now, that’s pretty confusing, right? Who would want to write that code again and again? Fortunately, there’s an easier way.
	When code is in a function, we can just say the function’s name and it will perform its job. All we have to do is tell it what we want it to do.
</p>

<pre>
$("#whereWeWantItToGo").append(“Clyde is a medoicre magician”);
</pre>

<p>
Let’s break this apart. What does the dollar sign mean? It means that we are using a special version of Javascript, called jQuery. The “#whereWeWantItToGo" is the name of the place we want the word to go. “Append” is the name of what function we want to happen. aPerson is what we want it to set.
</p>
<p>
  And there you have it. No need to even glance at the previous gobbledegook. Yes, it is the gobbledegook that causes all of this to happen, but we’re not worried about the causes. We’re only concerned with the effect.
</p>

<p>
	It’s with functions that programming really begins to feel like wizardry. The thing about functions is that they help programmers separate cause from effect. This makes programming more simple because it gives the programmer less to worry about.

                So now that we know about variables, comments, functions and so on, let’s go back to the phrase we wanted to translate.
</p>
<p>
<code>  Here is how I feel about Clyde.
  When someone clicks the button, please write out how I feel about Clyde in the space below. </code>   </p>
  <p>
    Now that we know everything we do know, hopefully the next part will make more sense. Click on the "Results" tab to test the code out for yourself. You can also click on the "edit in JSFiddle" button in the top right. That will pop open a new tab. In the new tab you will be able to change the code however you like. After you change it, hit the "run" button and see how things change. Don't be discouraged if you accidentally break everything. Accidentally breaking everything is what most programmers do all day.

              But wait. What if telling Clyde that you're over him isn't enough? What if you need a button that will say it several times with each click? This is where loops come in. It was Ada Lovelace who first devised the loop. All a loop does is repeat itself until someting changes. As the programmer, you get to choose what that something is.
               There are several different types of loop, but right now we're going to focus on <code>while loops</code>.
</p>
<p>
To understand while loops, let's look at my ex-boyfriend Clyde. On five separate occasions his rabbit bit me while we were onstage. The first four times I forgave the rabbit. The fifth time the rabbit bit me, I bit back. Let's translate that to JavaScript.
</p>
  <p>
    Now let's translate that into JavaScript.

  <p>
Maybe you have a higher tolerance for rabbit bites than I do. Feel free to go over and mess around with the code so that it fits your experience with rabbits.

  The project of mechanizing cognition, started by Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, is now consuming professions. Even worse, thanks to Ada Lovelace, it took me months to find out about Brad Pitt and Angelina’s break-up. You see, I usually only pay attention to celebrity gossip when the celebrity gossip has me cornered. The primary time when celebrity gossip has me cornered is when I am standing in the checkout line at the grocery store. The tabloid magazines gleam, hoping to get my attention. And when I’m in line, I have attention to spare. It’s then, waiting for my turn at the miniature conveyor belt, that I catch up on celebrity gossip. The magazine covers inform me of where various celebrities are on the merry-go round of marriage, pregnancy, and divorce.
</p>
<p>
  	But I haven’t had much time to read these magazine covers because I haven’t spent much time in grocery store check-out lines. Now my grocery store has a cohort of computer screens for me to check-out on. There’s no need for lines, no time for magazine covers, and no anxiety over how I will interact with the cashier. With these computers, the cashiers are becoming obsolete.
  </p>
  <p>
  	But the problem isn’t that cashiers are becoming obsolete, but that humans are. Variables and loops may seem harmless on the screen, but they are swallowing professions right and left. Automated cars are threatening to push truckers off the road. FDA approved medical devices are already administering anesthetic. Automated telemarketers are right now annoying as many people as they can.
  	With our future likely being written in code, it makes sense to increase Computer Science training in high schools. Ironically, the opposite is happening. “Introductory secondary school computer science courses have decreased in number by 17 percent from 2005. The number of Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Courses has similarly decreased by 33 percent.” Computer Science is the only STEM field that has seen a decrease in high school participation in the last 20 years (from 25% to 19%).
